## What it does

Turning a rough idea into an implementation plan a coding agent can actually
execute is hard: a single agent asked to "write the plan" tends to be confident,
shallow, and unchecked — it never argues with itself, and nothing validates that
the result is complete or that the file references it cites are real.

agent-quorum closes that gap. Instead of prompting one agent once, it runs a
panel of agents in an iterative **plan → critique → update** loop: one drafts a
plan, another tears it apart, the draft is revised against that critique, and
the cycle repeats until the criticism runs out. The output is a plan that has
survived adversarial review, has every `file:line` reference checked against
your workspace, and is schema-validated at every step — produced without any
agent ever being granted a tool that can write to disk.

Use it when you want a thorough, self-reviewed plan rather than a first draft,
and you would rather have several agents disagree their way to a good answer
than trust a single pass.

## How the loop works

You hand agent-quorum a prompt or a rough plan. A **creator** writes the first
draft. A **critic** then reviews it and reports concrete issues; the creator
revises the draft to address them. That review-and-revise cycle repeats until
the critic finds nothing left to fix — the point of **convergence** — at which a
reference validator and an optional fix pass clean up the final plan. If the
converged plan is large or has many phases, agent-quorum performs a **split**:
it emits a self-contained `plan.package/` directory so a weaker model can
execute one phase at a time.

Five roles drive that loop: the **critic** finds issues, the **creator** drafts
and revises, the **fixer** proposes reference fixes after convergence, the
**reviewer** checks the fixer's proposal, and the **translator** renders a
localized companion plan when you ask for one.

                              plan.final.<locale>.md
```

Those five roles map onto three providers (`codex`, `claude`, `cursor-agent`)
through a single declarative config, and every provider call runs in its own
process group under a byte-idle / semantic-idle / wall-clock watchdog.

## Glossary

- **role** — one job in the loop (critic, creator, fixer, reviewer, translator),
  each bound to a provider and a prompt skill.
- **runner** — the provider CLI a role calls: `codex`, `claude`, or `cursor`.
- **effort** — a preset (`low`, `high`, `max`) that selects the role-call
  topology and how aggressively provider sessions are reused.
- **convergence** — the point where the critic finds no remaining blocking
  issues, so the loop stops and finalizes the plan.
- **split** — emitting the converged plan as a multi-file `plan.package/` when it
  is large or has enough phases, so it can be executed one phase at a time.

## Quickstart

Install the CLI globally:

```sh
npm install -g agent-quorum
```

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 24 and at least one provider CLI (`codex`, `claude`, or
`cursor-agent`) installed **and authenticated** — each selected runner is
preflighted before the loop starts, so a missing login fails fast with a remedy
hint instead of stalling mid-run.

Create a task prompt and run the loop:

```sh
plan-loop --prompt my-task.md
```

By default the run writes its functional artifacts to
`~/.agent-quorum/runs/loop-<name>/` (where `<name>` derives from the input
filename) and its durable run record under `~/.agent-quorum/state/`. The files
you care about are:

- `plan.final.md` — the converged plan; always the entry point.
- `summary.md` — a one-page run summary (iterations, health, artifact paths).
- `plan.package/` — present only when the split policy fires; a self-contained
  directory (index, master plan, per-phase docs, journal, runbook, debt ledger)
  for phase-by-phase execution.

## CLI

A single `plan-loop` bin fronts these entry points:

```sh
plan-loop my-plan.md                      # core loop over an existing plan
plan-loop --prompt my-prompt.md           # create plan.v0 from a prompt first
plan-loop launch --effort high task.md    # detached background run + run.log
plan-loop status                          # pick a run (TTY) or scriptable listing
plan-loop show <name|id|PID|--last>       # a run's artifact paths and state
plan-loop logs <selector> [-f]            # print or follow a run's run.log
plan-loop intervene <selector> "note"     # inject operator guidance mid-run
plan-loop prune [--keep N] [--dry-run]    # bound the run ledger
```

Runs are addressable by a durable `runId`/`name` selector; see the end-to-end
walk-through in [`docs/run-lifecycle.md`](docs/run-lifecycle.md). The full flag
reference and exit codes live in [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md), and the plan
shape gate that existing plan inputs must satisfy is documented in
[`docs/architecture.md#plan-shape-contract`](docs/architecture.md#plan-shape-contract).
Non-English locales localize Telegram clarification questions and produce
`plan.final.<locale>.md`; Telegram credentials also enable concise final
completion notifications for core runs.

## Library

```ts
import { runPlanLoop, getRunStatus, addIntervention, ExitCode } from 'agent-quorum';

const result = await runPlanLoop({ input: 'my-plan.md', iters: 3, effort: 'high' });
if (result.exitCode === ExitCode.Ok) {
  console.log(`converged in ${result.iterations} iterations: ${result.finalPlanPath}`);
}
```

The API returns results — only the CLI calls `process.exit`. `runPlanLoop`
returns a structured result (`workDir`, `finalPlanPath`, `summaryPath`,
`iterations`, `health`) built from the same data as `summary.md`. See
[`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) for the full surface, including CommonJS use.

## Configuration

agent-quorum reads one config file: the packaged `plan-loop.json`, or the file
pointed at by `PLAN_LOOP_CONFIG_FILE`. There is no search chain. It has two main
sections: `settings` (iteration cap, effort, fix pass, locale, translation,
retries) and `roles` (per-role runner, model, reasoning level, and tool
permissions). Supported runners are `codex`, `claude`, and `cursor`.

A gitignored package-root `.env` is loaded before config resolution, with real
environment variables winning. It is intended for secrets such as Telegram bot
credentials, which enable final completion notifications automatically; set
`PLAN_LOOP_CLARIFY=0` for notifications without the prompt-mode question gate.

The full reference — every `PLAN_LOOP_*` variable, watchdog knob, Telegram
setting, status/launch toggle, and the exact CLI > env > file
[override precedence](docs/configuration.md#precedence) — lives in
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

## Platform support

| OS            | Status        | CI              |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| macOS 13+     | Supported     | `macos-latest`  |
| Linux (glibc) | Supported     | `ubuntu-latest` |
| Windows       | Not supported | —               |

Both macOS and Linux are tested on every push and pull request via the full
`pnpm run check` matrix (build · typecheck · lint · format · tests). Install the
provider CLIs you plan to use (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`,
`npm install -g @openai/codex`) and authenticate each. `cursor-agent` has no
official Linux package yet; point `PLAN_LOOP_CURSOR_BIN` at your Cursor headless
binary to use the `cursor` runner there (see
[`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md)). `plan-loop status` uses
`lsof` to resolve a running session's workdir when `--work` is omitted and
degrades gracefully without it (see [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md)).

## Development

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run check          # typecheck + lint + format check + tests with coverage
```

Code style, git, and verification rules live in
[`docs/development/conventions.md`](docs/development/conventions.md).

Work is tracked on the public
[**agent-quorum delivery** board](https://github.com/users/sensiloles/projects/2):
`Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done`. The `/issues` skill files session
follow-ups straight into the backlog, where they enter the delivery flow
([`docs/development/agent-skill-flow.md`](docs/development/agent-skill-flow.md)).

For changes that should be designed by `agent-quorum` itself, dogfood the loop
through the `plan-loop` bin straight from source — see [`examples/`](examples/)
for the full CLI and API walkthrough:

```sh
pnpm run plan:self -- --prompt .agents/prompts/<slug>.md
```

`plan:self` runs `src/cli/main.ts` via `tsx` (no build), points run artifacts at
`.agents/plans/`, and accepts the usual `--effort`, `--iters`, `--locale`,
`--translate`, and `--fix` / `--no-fix` flags; set `PLAN_LOOP_WORK_DIR` to pin a
workdir name.
