# agent-quorum Development Conventions

This document is the single source of truth for agent-quorum development conventions. It covers this project's stack (TypeScript, Node 24, ESM/NodeNext, pnpm, vitest, flat-config ESLint, Prettier, ajv) and architecture (a standalone CLI orchestrator, not a multi-repo workspace).

## Authority

When facts conflict, use this order:

1. This document for code, documentation, git, and verification conventions.
2. `eslint.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json` for machine-enforced rules — when this document and the linter disagree, the linter wins and this document is the bug.
3. `package.json` for scripts, exports, bin, and direct dependencies.
4. `docs/architecture.md` for roles, providers, the loop, and the artifact contract.

If a task exposes a real gap in conventions, scripts, or docs, report what happened, what is missing, and the proposed fix at task end.

## Language

- Code, comments, commits, configuration, tests, and docs use English.
- Operator-facing strings that ship in a non-English locale (the Telegram clarification copy, the companion plan) are selected by the `locale` setting, not hardcoded per language inside business logic. Keep the per-locale copy in one place (see `clarifyCopy` in `src/core/clarify.ts`) and the default English.

## Source Comments

Source comments are exceptional. Prefer names, types, tests, and structure that explain the code.

Allowed comments:

- critical non-obvious invariants;
- specific external bugs, provider quirks, or runtime constraints (for example why the translator runs claude with `--permission-mode default`);
- behavior that cannot be inferred from names and types.

Do not write comments that:

- restate what the code already says;
- describe the current task, branch, or PR;
- leave TODO/FIXME/HACK breadcrumbs;
- duplicate a function signature;
- preserve commented-out code.

Public API docs (the exported `runPlanLoop` surface in `src/index.ts`) may explain invariants, units, failure modes, and external contracts. Do not write parameter-by-parameter docblocks that repeat the type signature.

## Git

Commit format:

```text
type(scope): subject
```

Allowed types:

```text
feat fix refactor docs test chore perf ci build revert
```

Rules:

- Subject is fully lowercase.
- Header is at most 72 characters.
- Scope is optional.
- No trailing period.
- No `Co-Authored-By` lines.
- Use English.
- When the work was done as part of a GitHub issue, add a `Closes #<n>` line in the commit body so the issue auto-closes on merge (`Refs #<n>` when it touches the issue without resolving it).

Do not use force pushes, `--no-verify`, or `--allow-unrelated`. Never commit or push without explicit instruction.

## Project Commands

Use the `package.json` scripts:

```bash
pnpm run build        # tsc -p tsconfig.build.json
pnpm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm run lint         # eslint .
pnpm run format       # prettier --write .
pnpm run format-check # prettier --check .
pnpm run test         # vitest run --coverage
pnpm run check        # build && typecheck && lint && format-check && test
pnpm run dev          # tsx src/cli/main.ts
```

Use `pnpm exec <bin>` for repo-local binaries; never `npx`. `pnpm run check` green is the floor before claiming an implementation is done.

## Pre-commit Hook

The repository ships a pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit`. It runs
automatically on `git commit`:

1. `pnpm run format` — rewrites all files with Prettier.
2. `git add -u` — re-stages any files the formatter changed.
3. `pnpm run check` — runs the full build · typecheck · lint · format-check ·
   test pipeline; the commit is blocked if any step fails.

The hook is activated via `core.hooksPath .githooks`. `pnpm install` sets this
up through the `prepare` lifecycle script so any fresh clone works after
install. Never pass `--no-verify` to bypass the hook; the conventions forbid
it.

## Linting and Editor Tooling

- ESLint is flat-config only (`eslint.config.ts`). Do not add `.eslintrc*` files.
- The config layers `@eslint/js` recommended, `typescript-eslint` `strictTypeChecked` + `stylisticTypeChecked`, and `eslint-config-prettier` last. Prettier owns formatting; ESLint owns correctness and style-of-types.
- `strictTypeChecked` bans `any` (`no-explicit-any`), unsafe assignments, and floating promises. `stylisticTypeChecked` enforces `@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions` (`interface` for object shapes) among others. Do not disable these per-line to dodge a real finding — fix the code.
- Type-aware linting uses `projectService`; new files must be inside the `tsconfig.json` `include` globs (`src`, `tests`) or lint will not type-check them.

## TypeScript Compiler

`tsconfig.json` is strict and unforgiving by design. Write code that satisfies it without casts:

- `strict`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` — index access yields `T | undefined`; narrow it.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` — an optional field is absent, not `undefined`-valued; do not assign `undefined` to satisfy it.
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` — every `case` terminates.
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` — use `import type` / `export type` for type-only imports; emit-affecting imports stay value imports.
- `isolatedModules`, `module: NodeNext` — ESM only; relative imports carry the `.js` extension (`./config.js`), matching the compiled output.

## Architecture

agent-quorum is a standalone CLI that orchestrates the Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor Agent CLIs through an iterative plan → critique → update loop. It must build, test, and run from its own checkout with no external workspace. See `docs/architecture.md` for the roles, providers, loop, and artifact contract.

Source layers, outer depends on inner:

```text
cli -> core -> providers -> runtime
```

- `src/cli/` owns argument parsing and command entry points (`main`, `run`, `launch`, `intervene`, `help`). It resolves settings and builds the `RunContext`; it holds no orchestration logic.
- `src/core/` owns the orchestration domain: config resolution, the iteration loop, the critic/creator/fixer/reviewer/translate passes, the clarification gate, plan validation, resume, summaries, and the run context. Pure decision logic lives here.
- `src/providers/` owns the three provider adapters (codex, claude, cursor) behind a single `providerRun` entry point that owns retry, streaming, and the watchdog. Provider-specific quirks stay here.
- `src/runtime/` owns low-level technical primitives: process exec and teardown, env/dotenv loading, logging, filesystem helpers, scratch dirs, and the `HaltError` exit contract. No domain knowledge.
- `skills/` holds the role prompt skills and their JSON schemas, validated with ajv. Treat a skill `*.schema.json` as a contract: changing it changes the provider I/O shape.

Rules:

- Dependencies point inward only. `runtime/` imports nothing from `core/`, `providers/`, or `cli/`; `core/` does not import `cli/`.
- A helper used by one pass lives with that pass in `core/`, not in a shared bucket. Promote to a shared module only when a second consumer appears.
- Provider calls go through `providerRun`; never spawn a provider CLI directly from `core/` or `cli/`.

## Modules, Exports, and Imports

Use named exports. Avoid `export default` (the one exception is a future tool that genuinely requires it; none exists today).

```ts
export function resolveRunSettings(cli: CliSettings, file: string): RunSettings {
  // ...
}
```

Rules:

- Preserve public exports of `src/index.ts` unless a breaking change is explicit.
- ESM relative imports use the `.js` extension and import the specific module, not a re-export barrel, unless a barrel already exists.
- Generated and packaged files (`dist/`, `coverage/`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) are never hand-edited.

## Naming and Structure

Use domain names first, then technical role names. Prefer a precise file name (`translate-pass.ts`, `validate-plan.ts`, `clarify.ts`) over a catch-all. Avoid new generic `helpers`, `common`, `misc`, or `utils` buckets; `src/runtime/` already holds the genuinely generic primitives.

Do not abbreviate domain terms in project-owned names. Prefer `traceContext`, not `traceCtx`; `providerRuntime`, not `rt`; `runContext`, not `ctx`; `iteration`, not `iter`; and `previousCritiques`, not `prevCritiques`.

## TypeScript Style

### Blocks

Use braced, multi-line bodies for all control flow and function bodies, even for a single statement.

```ts
if (!settings) {
  return null;
}

for (const role of roles) {
  preflight(role);
}
```

Avoid brace-less or single-line control flow:

```ts
if (!settings) return null;
for (const role of roles) preflight(role);
```

This applies to every `if` / `else if` / `else` / `for` / `while` / `do…while` / `try` / `catch` / `finally`, and to function and method bodies. When you touch a file, bring the lines you change into this shape.

### Arrow Functions

Concise arrow bodies are fine for short, pure expressions:

```ts
const ids = entries.map((entry) => entry.id);
const active = roles.filter((role) => role.enabled);
```

Use a braced body with an explicit `return` when the callback has side effects, multiple steps, a long expression, nested logic, a non-trivial returned object literal, or exported behavior.

### Named Types

Extract object parameter and return shapes when they stop being trivial.

Extract when:

- a destructured parameter bag has three or more fields;
- a field is a union, generic, nested object, or array of objects;
- the function is exported;
- the object return has two or more fields;
- the shape is reused.

Use PascalCase and name them `<Function>Params` / `<Function>Result` (or `<Name>Options` for many-optional-field config).

Definition keyword — match the linter (`consistent-type-definitions`):

- Use `interface` for object shapes (parameter bags, return shapes, config records, role tables).
- Use `type` only for what an interface cannot express: unions, intersections, mapped/conditional types, tuples, and function-type aliases. The discriminated `WaitOutcome` union in `src/core/clarify.ts` is the model.

```ts
interface ResolveTranslatePassParams {
  readonly cliLocale: string;
  readonly envLocale: string;
  readonly fileLocale: string;
}

type WaitOutcome =
  | { readonly kind: 'answer'; readonly text: string }
  | { readonly kind: 'cancel' }
  | { readonly kind: 'deadline' };
```

### Type Safety

Use `unknown` plus narrowing at boundaries (parsed JSON, provider output, env). Do not use `any` — `strictTypeChecked` already forbids it; do not cast it back in with `as`.

Use discriminated unions and exhaustive checks. `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` is on; close exhaustive switches with `satisfies never`:

```ts
switch (outcome.kind) {
  case 'answer': {
    return outcome.text;
  }
  case 'cancel': {
    return undefined;
  }
  case 'deadline': {
    throw new HaltError('clarify deadline', 1, true);
  }
  default: {
    outcome satisfies never;
    throw new Error('unreachable');
  }
}
```

Use `readonly` by default for fields and array parameters; widen only where the function genuinely mutates.

### Nullability

Prefer `undefined` for absent values inside the domain. Use `null` only when an external system returns it; normalize at the boundary. Settings model "no value" as `undefined` on `CliSettings` and as the empty string only where the resolution chain already treats empty as missing.

### Time

`Date.now()` and `new Date()` are I/O. Keep them at the edges (the clarification deadline, run timestamps) and out of pure decision functions where practical; pass an injected clock when a function's result depends on the current time and needs to be tested.

### Values

Name meaningful literals as module constants (SCREAMING_SNAKE for primitives, `as const` objects for groups):

```ts
const DEFAULT_LOCALE = 'en';
const LEGACY_TRANSLATE_LOCALE = 'ru';
```

Inline literals only when they are local and self-evident (`0`, `1`, `''`).

### Booleans and Declarations

Booleans start with `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`, `did`, or `will`, and are named positively (`isReady`, not `isNotReady`). Extract a named boolean for any condition that joins three or more predicates or mixes negation with domain terms.

Use `const` by default. Use `let` only for genuine reassignment — prefer a guard-clause helper that `return`s over a `let` reassigned across an if/else ladder. Never use `var`; always use `===`.

## Errors

Throw typed errors with a stable, machine-readable shape. The project's exit contract is `HaltError` (carries an exit code); use it for operator-facing fatal exits and let it propagate to the CLI boundary.

Catch as `unknown` and narrow with `instanceof`. Catch narrowly at boundaries (a `JSON.parse` that may throw, a provider call that may fail) and turn the failure into a typed result or a `HaltError` — do not swallow errors silently and never branch on `err.message`.

## Logging

- Log through `src/runtime/log.ts` (`log` / `err`); do not call `console.*` directly in `core/` or `providers/`.
- Logs carry run metadata — role, provider, model, status, line counts, latency — not plan bodies, prompts, or secrets.
- The provider trace is metadata-only on both streams: tool-argument values, assistant prose, raw command bodies, and free-text retry/stderr reasons render as a kind, size, target path, command descriptor, or classified token — never the body. Raw stdout/stderr is reachable only behind the opt-in `PLAN_LOOP_PROVIDER_DIAGNOSTICS` escape hatch (see [`docs/configuration.md`](../configuration.md)).

## Security and Secrets

- Never commit `.env` files, tokens, or keys. Telegram and provider credentials (`PLAN_LOOP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `PLAN_LOOP_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, provider auth) come from the environment.
- Keep any `.env.example` current when local config keys change.
- Do not paste real secrets into docs, issues, commits, tests, logs, or prompts.

## Path Portability

Committed code and docs must work for any developer machine and clone location.

- Resolve user-local artifacts under `$HOME/.agent-quorum` — functional output in `runs/`, the durable run ledger in `state/` (overridable via `PLAN_LOOP_HOME`, or the legacy `PLAN_LOOP_PLANS_DIR` / `PLAN_LOOP_STATE_DIR` / `PLAN_LOOP_WORK_DIR`); resolve packaged assets relative to `packageRoot()`.
- In committed code and docs use `$HOME`, `~`, env vars, or package-relative paths — never an absolute clone path such as `/Users/<username>/...`.
- `docs/` and journals may keep historical absolute paths as an audit trail; do not normalize them retroactively.

Make breaking changes additively when there are external consumers of `src/index.ts`: add the new surface, migrate consumers, remove the old surface last — not in one commit.

## Documentation

- Documentation is code-adjacent and must stay current with changed behavior.
- Active docs (`README.md`, `docs/`, skill prompts) describe current behavior, not migration history.
- When code changes paths, flags, config keys, types, the public API, or the artifact contract, update the related docs (`docs/cli.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `README.md`, and any affected skill) in the same change.
- Keep docs readable: one topic per section, short tables for matrices, commands in fenced blocks.

## Dead Code and Cleanup

- An export is dead when nothing in `src`, `tests`, or `skills` references it — check imports, re-exports, tests, and string/schema references before deleting.
- Delete proved-dead code and commented-out code; inline a helper that drops to a single caller.
- Ask before changing reachable but suspicious logic.
- Typecheck after small cleanup batches so false positives are easy to isolate.

## Verification

Scale verification to risk and blast radius.

Routine change:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
```

Before claiming done, or for any behavior change:

```bash
pnpm run check
```

`pnpm run typecheck` green is the floor; `pnpm run check` green (typecheck + lint + format-check + tests with coverage) is the bar for a finished change.
