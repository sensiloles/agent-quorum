# API

```ts
import {
  runPlanLoop,
  launchPlanLoop,
  getRunStatus,
  addIntervention,
  listRuns,
  getRun,
  getRunLogPath,
  interveneRun,
  pruneRuns,
  ExitCode,
  type RunPlanLoopOptions,
  type LaunchPlanLoopOptions,
  type RunResult,
  type RunHealth,
  type LaunchResult,
  type CommandResult,
  type InterventionTarget,
  type RunLookupOptions,
  type RunRecord,
  type RunSelector,
  type RunState,
  type RetentionPolicy,
  type PruneResult,
  type Role,
  type Runner,
  type Effort,
} from 'agent-quorum';
```

The API is a thin, semver-deliberate surface over the same engine the CLI
uses. Functions return results; only the CLI calls `process.exit`. Operational
logging still goes to stderr and follows the CLI's metadata-only provider log
contract: normal logs omit prompt, plan, source, tool-argument, and raw provider
stderr bodies.

## Importing from CommonJS

The package ships a single ESM build, but Node ≥ 24 (already required by
`engines`) loads a synchronous ESM graph through `require()` natively, so a
CommonJS consumer works without a dual build:

```js
const { runPlanLoop, ExitCode } = require('agent-quorum');
```

For TypeScript consumers this resolution needs TS ≥ 5.8 with
`"module": "nodenext"`. On older toolchains, fall back to a dynamic import:

```js
const { runPlanLoop } = await import('agent-quorum');
```

`require.resolve('agent-quorum/package.json')` is also supported.

## runPlanLoop(options)

Runs the core loop to completion in-process.

```ts
const result = await runPlanLoop({
  input: 'my-plan.md', // plan file, or prompt file with prompt: true
  prompt: false,
  iters: 3,
  effort: 'high', // 'low' | 'high' | 'max'
  fix: true,
  locale: 'ru', // optional; localizes Telegram interaction + final companion plan
  translate: false, // optional compatibility toggle
  workDir: '/abs/path/loop-my-plan', // optional; takes precedence over PLAN_LOOP_WORK_DIR
  configFile: '/abs/path/plan-loop.json', // optional; takes precedence over PLAN_LOOP_CONFIG_FILE
});
// result: {
//   exitCode: 0,
//   workDir: '/abs/path/loop-my-plan',
//   finalPlanPath: '/abs/path/loop-my-plan/plan.final.md',
//   summaryPath: '/abs/path/loop-my-plan/summary.md',
//   iterations: 2,
//   health: { critic: 3, addressed: 2, new: 1, invalid: 0, validAddressedPct: 66 },
//   splitDecision: 'no-split',          // 'split' | 'no-split', present every run
//   packageDir: undefined,              // '/abs/path/loop-my-plan/plan.package' only when split
// }
```

`exitCode` follows the CLI contract (`ExitCode.Ok`, `ExitCode.SchemaInvalid`,
`ExitCode.Blocked`, …). The structured fields are built from the same data
that renders `summary.md`: `health` carries exactly the numbers of the
`final_health` line, `iterations`/`finalPlanPath`/`summaryPath` mirror their
summary lines; path fields are present only when the file exists, and failure
exits may carry `workDir` alone. `splitDecision` (`'split'` | `'no-split'`)
mirrors the `split_decision` summary line and is present whenever
`plan.split.json` was written; `packageDir` is present only when the split
policy fired and a `plan.package/` was emitted. Both are additive —
`finalPlanPath` is never replaced by a directory-only result, so existing
callers are unaffected. `runId` and `name` identify the run (the same id the
start surfaces report); they are additive on `RunResult`/`LaunchResult`.
Artifacts land in the resolved workdir; for `home`, `workDir`, and
`configFile` the precedence is option > environment variable > default
(`<home>/runs/loop-<name>` / `~/.agent-quorum` / the packaged `plan-loop.json`).
`home` relocates the whole artifact root (`runs/` + `state/`) without mutating
`process.env`.
`locale` is the typed counterpart of `--locale`; it defaults to `en`.
Clarification questions sent through Telegram target that locale. Non-English
locales also run the translate pass and write `plan.final.<locale>.md`; `en`
keeps the final plan English-only unless `translate` is explicitly enabled for
compatibility. The options are typed alternatives to mutating `process.env` — the
`workDir`/`configFile` plumbing itself never writes to the calling process
environment. (The package-root `.env` loader keeps its reference semantics
and still fills missing keys; see
[configuration.md](configuration.md).)

If `PLAN_LOOP_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and `PLAN_LOOP_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` are present,
`runPlanLoop` also sends the same best-effort completion notification as the
CLI. Notification failures are logged and do not alter the returned
`RunResult`.

## launchPlanLoop(options)

Detaches a run into its own process group with `run.log` redirection.

```ts
const { exitCode, output, workDir, pid, logPath } = await launchPlanLoop({
  input: 'task.md',
  resume: false,
});
// output: "started: task\n  pid:   …\n  log:   …\n  work:  …"
```

`workDir`/`pid`/`logPath` are the structured counterparts of the `output`
text. A detached launch cannot report `iterations`/`health` at detach time by
construction — once the run finishes, read the artifacts in `workDir`
(`summary.md`, `plan.final.md`). `workDir`/`configFile` options are forwarded
to the detached child through its environment copy; the parent `process.env`
is left untouched.

When Telegram credentials are present, completion notifications are sent by
the detached child run, not by the launch parent.

## getRunStatus(query?)

```ts
const all = getRunStatus(); // list every running plan-loop run
const one = getRunStatus(12345); // any PID in a run's process tree
```

Returns `{ exitCode, output }` with the rendered snapshot; exit 2 for an
unknown PID, 3 for a PID outside any plan-loop tree. The signature and behavior
are unchanged; with no query, `output` is now the scriptable run listing.

## addIntervention(workDir, message, target?)

```ts
const result = addIntervention('/path/to/loop-task', 'prefer the staged rollout', 'creator');
// result.output: "recorded intervention: …/operator-interventions.jsonl id=op-… target=creator"
```

`target` defaults to `'all'`; valid targets are `all | critic | creator |
fixer | reviewer` (the translator is deliberately exempt). `addIntervention`
keeps its `(workDir, message, target?)` signature.

## Selector lookups

```ts
const runs = listRuns(); // every run record under the resolved root
const run = getRun('my-plan'); // by name, runId (or prefix), or { kind: 'last' }
const log = getRunLogPath('my-plan'); // run.log path, or undefined if none exists
interveneRun('my-plan', 'prefer the staged rollout', 'creator');
const pruned = pruneRuns({ keepCount: 50, maxAgeDays: 30, dryRun: true });
```

`listRuns`/`getRun`/`getRunLogPath`/`interveneRun`/`pruneRuns` are the library
counterparts of the `status`/`show`/`logs`/`intervene`/`prune` commands. A
selector is a string token (pid, runId or prefix, or name) or a structured
`RunSelector` (`{ kind: 'last' }`, `{ kind: 'work'; value }`); a pid resolves a
live run only. `getRun` returns a `RunRecord | undefined` (a bare `--work`
selector has no record); `interveneRun` resolves the selector to its workdir
then delegates to `addIntervention`, returning `{ exitCode: 2 }` when nothing
matches. `pruneRuns(policy?)` removes terminal records only (never workdirs).

Each lookup accepts a trailing `RunLookupOptions` with `home?` so a run created
under a custom `home` is reachable without mutating `process.env`:

```ts
const run = getRun('my-plan', { home: '/tmp/sandbox' });
```

## ExitCode

```ts
enum ExitCode {
  Ok = 0,
  Usage = 1,
  UnknownPid = 2,
  SchemaInvalid = 3,
  EmptyOutput = 4,
  RuleViolation = 5,
  Blocked = 6,
  ClarifyCancelled = 7,
  SignalTeardown = 143,
}
```
