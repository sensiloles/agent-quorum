description: Harvest the current agent-quorum session for potential improvement and fix directions, cluster them, and create proposal-level GitHub issues that feed the delivery flow. Use when the operator asks to run /issues, capture follow-ups from this conversation as issues, file what we found as GitHub issues, or turn session insights into tracked proposals.

# issues

Read the current conversation, surface every potential direction for
improvement or fix that came up, cluster the related ones, and — after operator
confirmation — open one proposal-level GitHub issue per cluster. This is the
front door of the delivery cycle: each issue is a durable placeholder for a
future product flow, never a spec and never a solution.

- Upstream: an agent session that uncovered follow-ups, deferred work, gaps, or
  ideas while doing something else (investigation, review, feasibility chat,
  implementation).
- Downstream (later, per issue, not here): `/requirements` ->
  `/solution-handoff` -> `/prompt-architect` -> confirmed self-planning run.

This skill never starts `agent-quorum` and never edits the checkout. Its only
side effect is creating GitHub issues, and only after the operator confirms.

Follow the repository-root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` operating rules and
`docs/development/conventions.md`.

## Arguments

```text
/issues
/issues <focus or filter>
```

`$ARGUMENTS` is optional. Empty arguments means harvest the whole current
session. A focus argument narrows the harvest to a theme, surface, or subset
(for example a single subsystem, or "only docs/test gaps").

## Philosophy

An issue created here captures **what is worth doing and why**, never **how to
do it**. It is the seed of the product flow, so it must survive being read by
someone who was not in this conversation and must not bias the later
`/requirements` step toward any approach.

Each issue therefore states the opportunity or problem in outcome terms and
stops there. The clustering follows `/solution-handoff` discipline: merge
related directions into the smallest useful set, strip candidate edits and
future entity names, and route product-level ambiguity to the later flow rather
than resolving it inline.

The operator decides what gets filed. The agent proposes the clustered set; it
does not create issues unprompted.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Harvest the session

Re-read the current conversation and collect every potential direction for
improvement or fix, including:

- follow-ups the operator or agent explicitly deferred ("later", "revisit",
  "TODO", "out of scope for now");
- problems, defects, or risks surfaced during work but left unaddressed;
- gaps in rules, docs, tests, scripts, or architecture noted in passing (the
  `CLAUDE.md` Self-Improvement signal);
- ideas or proposals discussed but not acted on.

Ground every candidate in something actually said or found in this session. Do
not invent directions the conversation does not support. If a focus argument was
given, keep only candidates matching it.

### Step 2 — Cluster

Group related candidates into the smallest useful set of coherent directions —
one prospective issue per cluster. Merge near-duplicates and tightly coupled
items; split only when two directions would each need their own product flow.
Drop one-off, already-resolved, or trivially-actionable items (note them in the
report instead of filing them).

### Step 3 — De-duplicate against existing issues

Before proposing anything, check the tracker so nothing is filed twice:

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,labels
```

For each cluster, match against open issues by intent, not just wording. If a
cluster already has an issue, drop it from the create set and reference the
existing number in the report. If `gh` is unavailable or the repo has no GitHub
remote, stop and report that to the operator instead of guessing.

### Step 4 — Draft each issue

Draft every surviving cluster against the **Issue contract** below. Keep each
issue proposal-level and solution-free. Pick one label per issue from the
repository's existing label set (commonly `enhancement`, `bug`,
`documentation`, `question`); do not create new labels.

### Step 5 — Propose and confirm

Present the clustered set to the operator in the operator's conversation
language: for each prospective issue show the title, the one-line summary, and
the chosen label, plus any clusters dropped as duplicates (with the existing
issue number) or as out-of-scope.

Then ask for confirmation using the host's structured question tool when
available. Offer at least:

- create all proposed issues;
- create a chosen subset;
- revise titles/clusters first;
- create none.

Do not create any issue before the operator confirms. If the structured tool is
unavailable, ask in plain chat and treat creation as pending until explicit
approval.

### Step 6 — Create and report

On approval, create each confirmed issue:

```bash
gh issue create --title "<title>" --label <label> --body "<body>"
```

Report the created issue URLs (and any skipped/duplicate clusters) in the
operator's conversation language. Do not stage, commit, push, open PRs, or start
`agent-quorum`.

## Issue contract

The issue title and body are written in English (committed/external artifact).
Operator interaction stays in the operator's conversation language. Titles are
concise outcome statements, lowercase after the first word, no trailing period.

```markdown
## Summary

<one or two sentences: the opportunity or problem in outcome terms>

## Motivation

<why this is worth revisiting: the value if addressed or the cost if ignored>

## Context

Surfaced during an agent session on <YYYY-MM-DD>. <one line on what prompted it>.

## Area (orientation only)

<coarse subsystem or surface this touches, as a pointer — not a design>

## Next step

This is a proposal placeholder, not a specification. Before any implementation,
route it through the delivery flow:

`/requirements` -> `/solution-handoff` -> `/prompt-architect` -> confirmed
self-planning run.

Use the shortest chain that still preserves the needed decision boundary.
```

## Boundaries

- The issue body contains **no implementation details**: no chosen approach, no
  candidate edits, no code snippets, no `file:line` references, no named future
  entities, no effort or time estimates.
- Do not file directions the session does not actually support.
- Do not duplicate an existing open issue; reference it instead.
- Do not create issues before the operator confirms.
- Do not invent labels; reuse the repository's existing set.
- Do not edit the checkout, stage, commit, push, open PRs, or start
  `agent-quorum`. The only side effect is `gh issue create` after confirmation.

## Output

End with this checklist:

```text
Harvested: <n> candidate directions from this session
Clustered into: <m> prospective issues

Created:
  - #<n> <title> (<label>) -> <url>

Skipped:
  - <cluster> -> duplicate of #<n>
  - <cluster> -> out of scope: <reason>

Not run:
  - <reason, e.g. gh unavailable / operator created none>
```
